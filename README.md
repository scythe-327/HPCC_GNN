# HPCC_GNN

#### Our idea is to obtain the whole data of an image and to play around a bit to see what can be done using python libraries 
#### then to embed the desired code blocks/snippets in ecl

There are three jupyter notebooks:-

### 00_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
- contains our intial approach to extract the data using tensorflow library

### 01_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
- contains more of a remodfied way to extract data using numpy library
- a fuction call automatically strips the data

### 02_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
- contains the approach using struct module
- more or less like a manual method to strip and extract required data


## all the three notebooks contains the trial and error methods and our rough work used...... to refer/access the code snippets directly we are attaching a python file named "GNN_code_snippets_from_pynotebook.py"
