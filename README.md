# HPCC_GNN

#### Our idea is to obtain the whole data of an image and to play around a bit to see what can be done using python libraries 
#### then to embed the desired code blocks/snippets in ecl

There are three jupyter notebooks:-

### 00_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
- contains our intial approach to extract the data using tensorflow library

### 01_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
- contains more of a remodfied way to extract data using numpy library
- a fuction call automatically strips the data

### 02_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
- contains the approach using struct module
- more or less like a manual method to strip and extract required data

### 03_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
-An attempt to extract pixel data from jpeg images
-Using manual method to strip the jpeg image data.

### 04_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb
-An attempt to extract pixel data from BMP images
-Using manual method to strip the header.

###04_GNN_Project_Backup.ipynb

-we were asked to use the function NPList2Tens which needed the nparray as its parameter along with the correct shape , this is just the modified verison of the '#01_GNN_Project_backup'
-To obtain the size of the nparray we are utilizing the np.expanddims

## All the five notebooks contains the trial and error methods and our rough work used...... to refer/access the code snippets directly we are attaching a python file named "GNN_code_snippets_from_pynotebook.py"
